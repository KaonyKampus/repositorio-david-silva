                Hi, I'm David Silva, a 24-year-old based in Bogotá, Colombia.
                I hold a bachelor's degree in Modern Languages. 
                My passion for technology led me to pursue programming, 
                and I am currently studying Software Engineering. 
                I've completed several front-end programming courses for web development, 
                and I am participating in the ORACLE NEXT education program, 
                where I am training to become a back-end developer with Java.
            </p>

            <p class="main--paragraph">
                My professional experience has been focused on customer service. 
                Leveraging my communication skills in English, 
                I have worked as a technical support agent for various companies in the BPO industry, 
                including Asurion and Teleperformance.
            </p>

            <p class="main--paragraph">
                I completed my bachelor's degree in Modern Languages in 2022 at Universidad ECCI in Bogotá. For my graduation project, I co-authored a monograph in English with a fellow student titled 
                "Analysis of the Armies by Evelio Rosero: A View from the Subjectivity of Violence."
            </p>
            
            <p class="main--paragraph">
                I am passionate about road cycling, which I practice regularly, and I also enjoy writing poetry.
